## Introduction

This is the week 3 assignment in the Developing Data Products. I have intentionally kept it simple to include just one slide with an interactive plot using Plot-ly.

## Plot using Plot_ly for mtcars data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}

#suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))))


plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~cyl, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "MPG vs # cylinders")


```
